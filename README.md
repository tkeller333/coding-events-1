# coding-events-1

The purpose of the coding events app is to provide a place for users to list and find coding events.

The current state of the app allows users to add, view, and deleted events. The users can also create categories and view all the events in a category. The app displays the details of a specific event and allows the user to tag the event. The user can also create new tags.

Future improvements I would like to make to the app would include: clicking a tag to view all of the events with that tag and improving the appearance of the app. I would also like to add a person class which would make the app even more user friendly. The person class would have: 

	• Name - first and last
	• Location - link to location page with listing of events in that location
	• Occupation - link to events tagged with the occupation
	• Company - link to events involving the company the person works for or that have the company tagged
	• Events attended - links to events the person has attended in the past
	• Events attending - links to events the person is planning to or registered to attend
	• Areas of interest - tags of things the person is interested in, so related events can be suggested to the person
